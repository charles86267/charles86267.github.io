            <p>Hello, my name is Charles Lee. I’m originally from Taiwan and have been living in Appleton for three years</p>
            <p>This is also my third year at FVTC. I started with one year in the ELL program to improve my English, and for the past two years, I’ve been studying in the IT program.</p>
            <p>My interest in computers began in high school, where I first started learning computer skills.</p>
            <p>Technology fascinates me because it makes life better, and I’m motivated to keep learning and improving my skills.</p> 
            <p>I’m excited to continue expanding my knowledge in IT and exploring new opportunities in this field.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, and I’m a big fan of Marvel. My favorite Marvel movie is Guardians of the Galaxy, which I’ve watched more than five times.</p>
